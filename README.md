# Playground

To further explore the differences between with blocks and common tagged tuple scenarios.

One of my main gripes with with blocks is the order in which you read the code is very chaotic.
Also with blocks don't read like the rest of Elixir.

## Commands

to run: elixir main.exs
to format: mix format main.exs

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `playground` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:playground, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/playground>.
